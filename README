This is a simple PHP script which is used to generate a graph (using Google).
The data for the graph is taken from a Microsoft Excel which is loaded into an array via the simplexlsx.class.php class (not written by me).

My class (gxdata) creates an instance of the SimpleXLSX class, loads the data into an array then I traverse the array in two different which results in the same data being displayed in 2 different ways.
The index.php ultilizes jQuery to allow the user to do a bit of customization to the graph.
A class was created because I figure you might be looking to see the PHP language be used in an object oriented fashion.
